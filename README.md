Greenhouse Project
A smart greenhouse solution to create and maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.

📝 Overview
The Greenhouse Project is designed to help gardeners and farmers create a controlled environment for their plants. It optimizes temperature, humidity, lighting, and watering to ensure consistent and efficient growth while promoting sustainability.

🚀 Features
Climate Control: Maintain ideal temperature and humidity levels.
Watering System: Automate irrigation based on soil moisture levels.
Lighting Management: Use natural and artificial lighting for efficient growth cycles.
Real-Time Monitoring: View live data on environmental conditions.
Eco-Friendly Design: Optional integration with solar or renewable energy sources.
🛠️ Setup
1️⃣ Greenhouse Construction
Use materials such as glass, polycarbonate, or UV-treated plastic for structure.
Ensure proper ventilation and insulation.
2️⃣ Environmental Control
Install basic tools like thermometers, hygrometers, and soil moisture meters.
Use programmable thermostats and timers for temperature and light control.
3️⃣ Irrigation System
Set up drip irrigation or sprinklers.
Connect a water pump with a timer or manual control.
4️⃣ Lighting
Add grow lights or LEDs for indoor or low-light environments.
Ensure lights are placed at an appropriate distance from plants.
💡 How It Works
Monitor: Measure key metrics like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
Adjust: Modify watering, lighting, or ventilation based on environmental data.
Grow: Create the perfect ecosystem for plants to thrive.
