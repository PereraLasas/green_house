# Greenhouse Project
A smart greenhouse solution to create and maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.

## 📝 Overview
The Greenhouse Project is designed to help gardeners and farmers create a controlled environment for their plants. It optimizes temperature, humidity, lighting, and watering to ensure consistent and efficient growth while promoting sustainability.

## 🚀 Features
- **Climate Control:** Maintain ideal temperature and humidity levels.
- **Watering System:** Automate irrigation based on soil moisture levels.

##Components Used
Arduino Uno (or compatible Arduino board)
DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor (measures temperature)
Breadboard and Jumper wires (for connecting components)
LEDs(White,Green)
Water Pump
5V Relay Module

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Monitor:** Measure key metrics like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.  
2. **Adjust:** Modify watering, ventilation based on environmental data.  
3. **Grow:** Create the perfect ecosystem for plants to thrive.  

## 🌟 Benefits
- **Improved Plant Growth:** Consistent and optimized conditions.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Save water and energy with smart systems.  
- **Scalability:** Suitable for home gardens or commercial farms.  
- **Year-Round Growing:** Grow crops regardless of the season.  

## 📚 Use Cases
- **Home Gardening:** Cultivate fresh vegetables, herbs, and flowers year-round.  
- **Urban Farming:** Maximize fields in small spaces.  
- **Educational Projects:** Study plant behavior in controlled environments.  

## 📌 Maintenance Tips
- Clean sensors and monitoring tools regularly.  
- Check for leaks or blockages in the irrigation system.  
- Inspect plants for pests or diseases.  
- Replace worn-out components as needed.
